Digital Customer Engagement on AWS
Digital customer engagement is a tool for outbound marketing, by enabling a company to promote campaigns over the web or via apps, as well as a medium for sales departments to nurture interest amongst individual customers. These multiple applications highlight the broadness of Digital Customer Engagement, and perhaps why there is so much room for it still to grow.
Below is my attempt to showcase digital customer engagement on AWS using Amazon Personalize and Amazon Pinpoint. 

## Here is a high level architecture

## Amazon Pinpoint for customer engagement via multiple channels

## Amazon Personalize to provide relevant recommendations and  hence drive relevant marketing campaign to the customers

Both these component works great together but they can be easily used as individual solutions. 

**Note: The Dataset used is of retail grocery data and is dummy data. You should replace it with your business data**
